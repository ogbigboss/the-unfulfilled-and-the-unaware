# The Unfulfilled and the Unaware

## Intro

### June 1st 2024

"Adria, what if we just told them the truth?"

"The truth? The _truth_? That the reason we could prove the man was falsely accused was because we set up the false accusation ourselves?"

"Well, I don't know Adria, this has all gone so far and everyone in LA is suspicious of us anyway..."

Adria had always known Ryleigh was the weakest - she was the prettiest, prettier than Adria at least. That's why she made a plan to keep Ryleigh from talking from the very beginning.

"Ry - do you want to lose your kids like Rita? Remember that evening in Vegas? All I have to do is tell your wi-"

"No, no, nevermind. You're right. Nevermind!"

Adria shook her head and gave Ryleigh a cross look, than sat down to think. Ryleigh wasn't totally incorrect - this had gone rather far. The man was never supposed to be able to deduce the manner of his own innocence, a car theft report which proved his accuser a liar. Adria was a bit rash in this plan - it was just so much fun at the time, she had never really stopped to think how _obviously_ it would look like a setup - it was just so much fun to be around famous people, to be _important_ and _trusted_ around famous people rather than just in the background. And then there was the whole romance thing, which Sara reminded the group of.

"OK, so let's not tell them the truth. Everyone in Hollywood wants to get these two together, why don't we just do that?"

Adria knew Sara was loyal, and never had to keep her in check her like she always had to with Ryleigh. But Sara was... stupid. It made her useful to Adria, of course, but it was always a thing to deal with.

"Sara. We've been working the girl for a year now. Do you really think she'll be... ok with hearing about the false accusation?"

"But, it is a lie, right?" Sara stammered.

Ryleigh and Adria both looked at Sara and sighed openly. Adria began to protest that maybe they should just admit the truth, but stopped herself midsentence.

_I know. These two need a pep talk._

"Ok guys, keep it together. If it's one thing I learned from my time with the CIA, it's that you never, ever, ever back down from the mission. Ever!"

But Adria hadn't actually learned that from her time with the CIA - she hadn't learned much. She was basically a mail clerk in DC for higher ups, but these two hung on her every sentence that involved the acronym from her resume. They got to know her through her self published books, which in turn were from the stories she heard in the office from other people and wrote to be as her own. Adria's relationship with Sara and Ryleigh was built on this lie, so Adria had no shortage of confidence maintaining the relationship through lies. She just needed another one.

Sara and Ryleigh awaited their master's command, having been silenced by the reminder that they weren't spy affiliated, they were author affiliated.

"So, we have a mission: to make a Reality TV show out of all this. We have two problems: our original Hollywood backers now are suspicious of us being moral monsters, and the man is making it publicly known to Hollywood that he'd like to get together with the girl
