## Intro: Dream Deprivation

"Adria, what if we just told them the truth?"

"The truth? The _truth_? That the reason we could prove the man was falsely accused was because we set up the false accusation ourselves?"

"Well, I don't know Adria, this has all gone so far and everyone in LA is suspicious of us anyway..."

Adria had always known Ryleigh was the weakest - she was the prettiest, prettier than Adria at least. That's why she made a plan to keep Ryleigh from talking from the very beginning.

"Ry - do you want to lose your kids like Rita? Remember that evening in Vegas? All I have to do is tell your wi-"

"No, no, nevermind. You're right. Nevermind!"

Adria shook her head and gave Ryleigh a cross look, then sat down to think. Ryleigh wasn't totally incorrect - this had gone rather far. The man was never supposed to be able to deduce the manner of his own innocence, a car theft report which proved his accuser a liar. Adria was a bit rash in this plan - it was just so much fun at the time, she had never really stopped to think how _obviously_ it would look like a setup - it was just so much fun to be around famous people, to be _important_ and _trusted_ around famous people rather than just in the background. And then there was the whole romance thing, which Sara reminded the group of.

"OK, so let's not tell them the truth. Everyone in Hollywood wants to get these two together, why don't we just do that?"

Adria knew Sara was loyal, and never had to keep her in check her like she always had to with Ryleigh. But Sara was... stupid. It made her useful to Adria, of course, but it was always a thing to deal with.

"Sara. We've been working the girl for a year now. Do you really think she'll be... ok with hearing about the false accusation?"

"But, we've been telling the famous people who paid us that she'll get it, and well, it is a lie, right?" Sara stammered.

Ryleigh and Adria both looked at Sara and sighed openly. _Of course it's a lie, but who would want to be associated in anyway to such a lie?_ though Adria. Ryleigh began to protest that maybe they should just admit the truth, but stopped herself midsentence.

_I know. These two need a pep talk._ Adria stood upright and began to speak, hands on her hips:

"Ok guys, keep it together. If it's one thing I learned from my time with the CIA, it's that you never, ever, ever back down from the mission. Ever!"

But Adria hadn't actually learned that from her time with the CIA - she hadn't learned much. She was basically a mail clerk in DC for higher ups, but these two hung on her every sentence that involved the acronym from her resume. They got to know her through her self published books, which in turn were from the stories she heard in the office from other people and wrote to be as her own. Adria's relationship with Sara and Ryleigh was built on this lie, so Adria had no shortage of confidence maintaining the relationship through lies. She just needed another one.

Sara and Ryleigh awaited their master's command, having been silenced by the reminder that they weren't spy affiliated, they were author affiliated.

"So, we have a mission: to make a Reality TV show out of all this. We have two problems: our original Hollywood and Musician backers now are suspicious of us being moral monsters, and the man is making it publicly known to Hollywood that he'd like to get together with the woman, recognizing they've all been writing songs and hinting at in movies for about for the past two to three years. He looks good, and we look bad. If we get them together now, that's how it ends, at best."

"What do we do then, Adria? I'm just so tired... we've been flying back and forth between coasts and I'm so jet lagged I can barely think" Ryliegh stammered.

Adria looked at Ryleigh and sighed, thinking about how pathetic she was. Adria needed that at first given that Ryleigh had the best house in this wretched New Jersey suburb they were forced to operate in, but her attitude was intolerable. Tired? What the hell is tired? You couldn't get away with complaining like that in the CIA, even if you just worked a desk job, but Ryleigh didn't know that about Adria. Who did Ryleigh think she was talking to?

"Maybe we should all just sleep on it" offerred Sara.

Amidst her anger at her dimwitted co-conspirators, a light went off in Adria's head: _Sure, hey, I didn't do much in the CIA, but it's not like I didn't read the news about what they were actually doing._

Adria began, with renewed vigor: "So the man may not know it, but he's getting in the way of our dream - depriving us of it. We all know he's gonna get a better life when this is over, but what about us? What will we get?  He's taking away everything we've been working for just by running that damn mouth of his!"

Sara and Ryleigh's eyes drew a sharper focus, and they began to nod. _Good, they agree: he's no hero, he's the enemy._

Adria continued: "So if he's gonna deprive of us our dreams, all while we're setting him up for his no matter what - who wouldn't want to be famous? we did that for him! - then let's use that fame against him: We're gonna get Hollywood to fucking _hate_ this guy for the thing they wanted, that stupid fucking storybook romance. _Beauty and the Beast_ my ass! Only a bunch of rich know nothings would think making a Disney story real would be realistic! We're gonna get the guy to give up on the girl - just like the end of _1984_, and we're gonna get Hollywood to hate him for it! Then they'll hate him and love us, and we'll make a Reality TV show out of it! They'll forget all about the accusation, shit, they might even wish it were real after how bad we make him look!"

Sara and Ryleigh looked excited, as if they were infected with the vigor of Adria's purpose. Sara asked the obvious next question: how?

Adria smiled, wickedly, and spoke: "Just a little thing I learned from the CIA - Sleep. Deprivation. We're gonna drive him crazy."

Ryleigh looked confused - "Uhm, we're gonna tie him up by his hands and yank the cuffs everytime before he passes out?"

Adria laughed, then paused - _maybe... no, no that'd make us look bad. Plan A it is_. "Remember? The speakers that were setup in his vents? How easy it is to control his dreams? I say, if he's depriving us of our dreams, well, we'll give him something to dream about. He'll talk, say things we can record and share with Hollywood, and while they'll be thinking we're setting the romance up, we'll get him to say things that will negate that. Let's start by making sure our poetically inclined Disney fan feels especially... appreciated by the gossip we cause."

Adria, Ryleigh, and Sara looked on as the man wrote into his laptop, posting the introduction to his novel publicly, and under a female psuedonym of all things. And mere days before the period in his life was going to be over! They weren't going to let him get any sleep tonight, that was for sure. They had nothing else to live for after all. This was the apex of their pathetic, meaningless, middle aged lives: sleep depriving a middle aged man they were hired to be the saviors to.
